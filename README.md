## Introduction

## Contents

This project contains two models and associated frameworks.
Both models require an [environment file](in.txt).

### Base model
- [agentframework.py](agentframework.py)

  Defines the Agent class that is used in the model.

- [model.py](model.py)

  Sets up and runs the model:
    
    1. Loads the environment.
    2. Scrapes the initial agent locations.
    3. Runs the model inside of a GUI.
    4. Writes to the store file.

### Enhanced model
- [enhancedframework.py](agentframework.py)

  Defines the Agent class and the Sheep and Pred subclasses that are used in the model.

- [enhancedmodel.py](model.py)

  Sets up and runs the model. Note that this doesn't run in a GUI.
